# Predication-of-Cirrhosis-disease-
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting cirrhosis disease using patient data. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify individuals at risk of cirrhosis, enabling earlier diagnosis and better clinical decision-making.

##The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploration of various machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Visualizations to interpret model performance and feature importance

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to patient data, including clinical test results, medical history, and other relevant factors. It include features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Bilirubin levels
- Albumin levels
- Prothrombin time
- Hepatomegaly history
And other medical markers

# Technologies used:
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and modeling
- Machine Learning algorithms for classification and prediction

# Modeling Process
- Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
- Model Training:
Use a variety of models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines to train on the dataset.
- Model Evaluation:
Evaluate models using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search) to optimize model performance.
- Model Selection:
Based on evaluation metrics, select the best-performing model for prediction.

# Evaluation
Once the model is trained, evaluate it using the following metrics:

Accuracy – The percentage of correctly predicted instances.

Precision – The percentage of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.

Recall – The percentage of relevant instances that were retrieved.

F1-Score – The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

AUC-ROC Curve – Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.
